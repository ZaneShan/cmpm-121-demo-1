This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

Credit to "coffee for the gone" https://maozblan.github.io/cmpm-121-demo-1/ for their incredible clean design (and sidebar idea which I used)
and to Cookie Clicker for tooltip inspiration! https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/
